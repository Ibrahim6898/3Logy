    The Story in the Book
</h1>
<h2>
    Chapter 1
</h2>
<p>
    Molly had been staring out of her window for about an  hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
</p>
<p>
    She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde qoute proclaiming that <q>work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonuclic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
